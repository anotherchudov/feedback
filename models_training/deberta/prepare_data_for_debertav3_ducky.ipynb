Wood found that 65% of students who participated in extracurriculars said they enjoyed the additional challenges that were presented to them, and actually continued to work harder and challenge themselves not only in their education, but also in the workforce. This means that teens and kids who entered after schoolÂ clubs and sports teams worked harder and were able to learn how to overcome obstacles and challenges. This also goes to show how students that entered extracurricular activities did indeed improve their work ethic.
